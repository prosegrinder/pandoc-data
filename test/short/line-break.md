A lot of people don't know how to handle soft and hard scene breaks. In a manuscript, rather than leaving a blank line you should center the character "#" on a line by itself. Do this for every line break, not just for ones that fall at the top or bottom of a page. As you edit and revise your manuscript prior to submission, those breaks can move around, and word processors often hide blank lines that come at the start or end of a page. You don't want your scene breaks rendered invisible to your editor.

Unescaped hashtag becomes an empty Heading 1:

#

Escaped hashtag is rendered, but not centered:

\#

For Markdown to render a linebreak properly, the `<br/>` tag is commonly used:

<br/>

What happens if you want to indicate where an actual line should go for a hard break? Typically, authors use many asterisks, at least 3 (***).

In Markdown, the convention for a horizontal rule is given by asterisks (***), dashes(---), or underscores (___) according to [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax#horizontal-rules).

Many short story authors also use triple hashes (###) to indicate a line break, [as recommended by Shunn](https://www.shunn.net/format/2012/08/differentiating_major_and_mino.html).

Testing triple hyphens.

Except for paragraph indentations, the left margin of your manuscript should be ruler-straight. The right margin, however, should be ragged, not justified. Right justification messes up the spaces between words and sentences and makes the manuscript more of a chore to read.

Testing multiple hyphens:

-----------

Testing triple underscore:

___

Testing triple asterisk:

***

Testing multiple asterisk:

***************

Testing triple hashes:

###

Testing escaped hashes:

While you'll find certain variations in the way different writers format their manuscripts, no one departs very far from what I've outlined above. But always check a market's submission guidelines before sending your work. If their guidelines differ from mine, follow theirs.

Finally, though you don't need to make any overt indication, some writers choose to center the word "END" after the last line of a story. This can help avoid ambiguity if your final words fall near the bottom of the page.

At the very least, these suggestions will guarantee your work looks professional. How the story itself comes across is an entirely separate matter--and that part's all up to you. Best of luck![^copyright]
