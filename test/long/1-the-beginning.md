# Part I
# Chapter 1
## A Snowy Dove

Jenna Kemp, mayor of Sun Forge, folded her thinkrag in half and pushed it away. She sat back in her chair, staring down the length of the conference table. It was morning and she was alone in the council chamber, which was probably a blessing. Had anyone else been present, she couldn’t have hidden her uneasiness, and uneasiness made her surly and fractious. 

The latest harvest figures were in, and C-ration numbers were down over the previous year. Heavy snows in winter always meant slower regrowth in the spring, but even taking that into account, Jenna foresaw trouble. There was still enough wheat, milk, and eggs to supplement the rations, but there might not be the next year, or the year after. 

That was if the harvesters stayed within a kilometer of the moat, of course. They could venture farther out into the barrens, but that required progressively more water. It might be all right this year since the snow pack in the mountains was so high, but what would happen after the next dry winter? The choice might come down to gathering food or maintaining the moat, and that was no choice at all. 

Jenna sighed. The root problem was simple: Sun Forge was exceeding its ideal population. They took more raw materials out of the barrens in the form of food, clothing, and other supplies than they put back in waste and dead bodies. But when things were going well people didn’t want to hear about birth control, and those first-aid kits with the condoms in them didn’t show up very often anyway. They had no equipment for safe abortions, but that hardly mattered. Religiously the town had gone so far overboard in the past twenty years that mention of the word might get her thrown out of office, if not over the moat. 

Maybe it was time to start encouraging exploration again. Early on, it seemed every young person in town had wanted to face the barrens one on one, and half of those who left never came back. Jenna had gone out twice herself when she was still full of juice. But as the years slipped by, as the satellite news worsened and it became increasingly clear that no rescue was coming, as the U.N. quarantine of North America took effect, these missions had slowly tapered off. There didn’t seem to be any point. No one but Carl McFarland and his little buddy Orrin Pritchard had traveled more than a kilometer into the barrens in over a decade. 

Elbows on the table, Jenna ran her hands through her curly, graying hair. She’d been sixteen when the tide came in; fifty- six was an age she had never expected to see. There’d been times when the town was so close to collapse that another year seemed too much to hope for, let alone another month. Every day was a battle, but at least rescue had seemed possible. Now Jenna was tired and stability her fondest wish. Her dreams of escape from Sun Forge were long dead. 

She pushed her chair back roughly from the conference table. She didn’t want to deal with problems like this anymore, but if she didn’t then who would? The majority of the town’s twenty- three hundred residents were under forty. They had no idea what life was like before the tide. C-rations and army fatigues were all they’d ever known for food and clothing, and since few of them paid attention to the news, their world was no larger than the harvest zone outside the moat. Who could do this job if she didn’t? Who would do it when she was gone? The council was worthless, including her husband Ray, and no one younger seemed interested in taking over for them. 

Cold morning sunlight streamed in through the picture windows, picking out a century’s nicks and scars on the surface of the conference table. Tree branches speckled with tiny new buds threw their stark shadows into the room. Jenna pushed the folded computer into a patch of sunlight to recharge, then reached into the breast pocket of her camouflaged shirt. She took out a tattered holo of her father, Harold Thomas. 

Jenna smoothed out the dog-eared, foil-backed picture in another slanting sunbeam. Her father’s head and shoulders appeared, solid and in full color, only faintly blurry, seeming to extend far deeper than the thickness of the foil. Jenna had inherited her mother’s nose, mouth, and hair, but her gray eyes and stocky build came straight from her father. “What would you tell me if you were here, Dad?” Jenna asked. “What would you tell me to do?” 

Probably not much of anything. Her father would be in his nineties if he were still alive--but then again, they might not be here if her father were still alive. The day the tide came in, Harold Thomas had been all for hightailing it out of town. It was McFarland, the so-called expert, who convinced him to dig in and fight. Her father died that same afternoon when an airborne puff of silver hit him full in the face. It swarmed over his head and down his throat, smothering him to death before anyone could douse him with water. 

Jenna had watched it happen. She still woke up soaked some nights, her father’s head bright in her mind’s eye, gleaming like some fearsome liquid robot’s, slowly shrinking, dissolving, as its gaping mouth opened wide in a silent cry. Mostly the head was her father’s, but sometimes it was her own. 

If only McFarland hadn’t interfered, the whole family might have gotten safely to Lake Tahoe, or even to the coast. Jenna had never forgiven him for that, and she knew she never would. 

Her father’s holo flickered in and out of solidity as a fluttering of dark shadows eclipsed the sunlight. Something tapped at the window--a bird, apparently attracted by its own reflection. At first the sun swallowed its color and shape, but when it settled down on the ledge and furled its wings, Jenna saw that it was a white dove. 

Chills raced up her spine. She tucked the holo into her pocket and pushed her chair back slowly, never taking her eyes from the window. Her legs trembled as she crossed the room and cracked the door. “Jim! Silvia!” she called softly. “Come here a minute! Quick!” 

As Jenna sat down again, she heard the thumping of Jim Ivie’s crutch. The door swung open. 

“Shh, shh, shh,” Jenna said, waving her hands. “No sudden moves. Don’t scare it away.” 

Jim, who ran the resource pool, moved carefully into the room. He was about thirty-five, but the freckles scattered across his nose and cheeks made him look younger. His square, handsome face seemed creased in a perpetual smile. He leaned on a single homemade wooden crutch. The left leg of his khaki fatigues hung pinned shut and empty. “Don’t scare what away?” 

“The bird, the bird,” Jenna said excitedly. 

“Oh, wow.” Jim leaned his crutch against the table and eased himself into one of the council chairs. The dove preened itself on the ledge. “That’s really pretty, Mayor. What kind of bird is it?” 

“You don’t recognize it?” 

Jim shook his head. “Looks kind of like a pigeon, but not quite. Wasn’t it Glenda Jones used to keep some pigeons on Lovelock Street?” 

Jenna nodded, barely keeping herself in her chair. “Filthy birds,” she said. “But not this one. Not this one.” 

“What is it? Where did it come from?” 

*Lord, what a dull man,* Jenna thought. *Strong, brave, ependable, but dull as a cat’s scratching post.* The dove strutted on the ledge, its chest puffed out as if it were courting its own reflection. Jenna pointed at it, trying to still the shaking in her hand. “You don’t know anyone in town who has a bird like that, do you?” 

“I didn’t think *anyone* had birds anymore,” Jim said. “’Less you mean chickens or turkeys. This sure is a pretty one, though. What kind did you say it was?” 

Silvia Gonsalves entered the room. She was a thick, matronly woman near fifty, with dark hair pulled back in a severe bun. She ran the supply room across the lobby. “I’m sorry I took so long, Mayor,” she said. “I was in the middle of--” Three steps into the council chamber, Silvia blanched and dropped to one knee. *“El Espiritu Santo,”* she said, crossing herself. 

“So you know what it is, too.” Jenna rose from her chair to approach the window. Bright coins of sunlight, reflections from the silvery sea beyond the moat, flashed between the houses and trees lining the next street. Jenna had to squint to study the bird. She glanced over her shoulder. “You recognize it.” 

Silvia nodded, an overstuffed olive in her green fatigues. “I know it from the stained glass window at St. Mark’s, the scene where John baptizes Jesus. It is the sign of the Holy Spirit-- the dove.” 

“A dove?” Ivie asked, reaching for his crutch. “You’ve got to be kidding. Where in the world would a dove have come from?” He stood up, trying to peer past Jenna at the miraculous bird. “My gosh, I’ve never seen one before. That’s something.” 

“Yes, it’s really something,” murmured Jenna. The bird was cleanly, brilliantly white, brighter far than the whitewashed walls of the council chamber. As a girl Jenna had dreamed of astronautics--seeing Earth from orbit, living on the Moon or in the Mars colony, or cataloguing the asteroids. Now she felt much the same excitement. “There’s another dove in the Bible, you know,” she said. “It’s the one Noah sent out from the ark to find dry land.” 

Jenna and the others watched the dove in reverent silence, until, startled by who knew what, it flapped away in a white flurry.
